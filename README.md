We investigated the effectiveness of Neural Style Transfer for 
transferring the style of photographs to artwork to improve
object detection in abstract artwork. This attempts to solve the
_cross-depiction problem_, the problem of recognizing objects in 
images independent of what style (drawn, photographed, painted) 
they are shown in.

We tested various methods of style removal and compared their performances
on YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection
model.
